This Python program allows users to input boolean values for A and B and evaluate key logical operations:
- Conjunction (AND)
- Disjunction (OR)
- Negation (NOT)
- Implication (IF...THEN)
- Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF)

## Features

- Accepts user input as 0 or 1
- Displays evaluated results
- Generates a complete truth table for A and B
- Runs in the terminal with clear instructions

## How to Run

1. Clone the repo or download the `logical_app.py` file.
2. Open a terminal in the project folder.
3. Run the program using:

```bash
python logical_app.py
